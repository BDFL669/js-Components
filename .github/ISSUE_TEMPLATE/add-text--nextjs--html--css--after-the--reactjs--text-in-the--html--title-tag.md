There is a Mistake in .html file's title tag. It is "Js Components - ReactJs & Tailwindcss Components & Templates" but it should be like this "Js Components - ReactJs, Nextjs, Html, Css & Tailwindcss Components & Templates".

*So To Fixed it:*

Just Go to the `Index.html` file and find the title Tag and Edit it to this "Js Components - ReactJs, Nextjs, Html, Css & Tailwindcss Components & Templates"
